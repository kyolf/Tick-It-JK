# Title: Tick-it
by Kyle Szeto, Jamie Wang <br>

## Production App <br>
http://tick-it-jk.herokuapp.com/

## Description <br/> 
This App was brainstormed up while we, as students, sat in a slack channel waiting for a response on a heavy request day, but not really knowing when a response would come, or what our standing was. Enter in Tick-it, the web app that allows Thinkful TA's and students to stay organized on a transparent platform. TA's are able to keep track of requests submitted by students who need assistance with a variety of coding challenges, while students are able to keep track of the requests they have submitted and where they line up on the queue. 

## Technology Used <br/>
**FrontEnd**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux<br/>
**BackEnd**: NodeJS, Express, Passport, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mlab<br/>
**Deployment**: Heroku, Travis <br/> 

## Things to do in Future
* Change the flow of the home page such that you can go to the ticketlist w.o. submitting a ticket
* Only allow TA's to take only 1 ticket at a time
* Only allow TA's to delete the ticket they took!
* Create student users that are only allowed to edit or delete their own ticket
